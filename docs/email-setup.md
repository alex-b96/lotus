# Email Notifications Setup Guide

## Overview
The LOTUS Poetry website now includes email notifications for authors when their poems are approved or rejected by administrators.

## Required Environment Variables

Add these variables to your `.env` file to enable email notifications:

```bash
# SMTP Server Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com          # Gmail SMTP server (or your provider's SMTP)
SMTP_PORT=587                     # Port for TLS/STARTTLS (use 465 for SSL)
SMTP_SECURE=false                 # Set to 'true' for SSL (port 465), 'false' for TLS (port 587)

# Email Authentication
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com    # Your email address for sending notifications
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password       # Your email app password (NOT your regular password)
SMTP_FROM=your-email@gmail.com    # From address for outgoing emails (usually same as SMTP_USER)
```
