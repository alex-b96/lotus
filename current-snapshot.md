## Current State Summary

**LOTUS is a beautifully designed, fully functional frontend prototype.** The UI/UX is production-ready with sophisticated interactions, responsive design, and excellent user experience. All visual features work perfectly, but the application requires backend integration to become a fully functional poetry platform.

The codebase demonstrates excellent React/Next.js practices, clean component architecture, and professional-grade styling. It's ready for backend integration and could be deployed as a demo or presentation of the intended final product.
