# LOTUS Poetry Website - Current Project Snapshot

**Date:** January 2025
**Project Name:** LOTUS - Poetry Website
**Technology Stack:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
**Status:** Frontend prototype + Backend authentication + Comments system + Authors section implemented

---

## Project Overview

LOTUS is a poetry community website designed as a "digital sanctuary where poetry blooms and creative souls connect." The project has evolved from a frontend-only prototype to having a working authentication system with database integration, a fully functional comments system, and a complete authors section. Real user login, commenting, and author browsing are now functional, while other features remain as sophisticated UI mockups.

**Core Concept:** Just as a lotus rises from muddy waters to bloom in pristine beauty, the platform provides a space for poets' creative journeys to flourish.

## Testing the Current State

### ✅ **Working Features to Test:**
1. **Authentication:**
   - Go to `/login`
   - Use: sarah@example.com / password123
   - Should successfully log in and redirect to homepage

2. **Authors Section:**
   - Go to `/authors` to see all authors with published poems
   - **Search functionality** - search by author name or bio
   - **Sort options** - sort by poem count, name, or join date
   - **Pagination** - navigate through multiple pages of authors
   - Click "View Profile" to go to individual author pages (`/authors/[id]`)
   - **Author profiles** show bio, website, stats, and all published poems
   - **Navigation** - back buttons and proper routing

3. **Individual Poem Pages with Comments:**
   - Go to `/poems` and click on any poem
   - Should navigate to `/poems/[id]` with specific poem content
   - **Comments section should show real comments from database**
   - **Try adding a new comment** (requires login)
   - **Edit your own comments** using the dropdown menu
   - **Delete your own comments** with confirmation
   - **Load more comments** if there are multiple pages

4. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Log in as admin (sarah@example.com)
   - Access `/admin` to see submitted poems
   - Approve and reject poems to test moderation workflow

5. **Database Verification:**
   - Run `npx prisma studio`
   - Verify users, poems, comments, and other data exist
   - **Check comments table** for newly added comments

### 🎭 **Mockup Features to Test:**
1. **Registration:** Form works but only shows loading, doesn't save
2. **All other forms:** Work perfectly but don't persist data
