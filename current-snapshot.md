# LOTUS Poetry Website - Current Project Snapshot

**Date:** January 2025
**Project Name:** LOTUS - Poetry Website
**Technology Stack:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
**Status:** Frontend prototype + Backend authentication implemented

---

## Project Overview

LOTUS is a poetry community website designed as a "digital sanctuary where poetry blooms and creative souls connect." The project has evolved from a frontend-only prototype to having a working authentication system with database integration. Real user login is now functional, while other features remain as sophisticated UI mockups.

**Core Concept:** Just as a lotus rises from muddy waters to bloom in pristine beauty, the platform provides a space for poets' creative journeys to flourish.
