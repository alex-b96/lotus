# LOTUS Poetry Website - Current Project Snapshot

**Date:** January 2025
**Project Name:** LOTUS - Poetry Website
**Technology Stack:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
**Status:** Frontend prototype + Backend authentication implemented

---

## Project Overview

LOTUS is a poetry community website designed as a "digital sanctuary where poetry blooms and creative souls connect." The project has evolved from a frontend-only prototype to having a working authentication system with database integration. Real user login is now functional, while other features remain as sophisticated UI mockups.

**Core Concept:** Just as a lotus rises from muddy waters to bloom in pristine beauty, the platform provides a space for poets' creative journeys to flourish.

## Current State Summary

**LOTUS has successfully transitioned from a pure frontend prototype to having a working backend foundation.** The authentication system is production-ready, the database is properly designed and populated, and users can now log in with real credentials.

The next phase involves connecting the existing beautiful UI to the database and creating the remaining API endpoints. The foundation is solid and ready for rapid feature development.

**Key Achievement:** Real authentication works! Users can create accounts and log in with actual database verification.
